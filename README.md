# Smart-POS-System
With the rapid development of computer technology, mechanical registers in retail stores are being replaced by point-of-sale (POS) systems. POS systems have been used to build core capabilities and enable sustained competitive advantages.Historically, vendors of POS systems have focused their marketing efforts on large chain stores, but now they have turned their attention to small businesses because of their significant potential to grow and expand. Further, the development of powerful computer hardware and user-friendly software has encouraged small business owners in the retail and service fields to use POS systems.Enticing experience by retailers or wholesalers is the fundamental key to the success of their business and to achieve this experience, there are some requirements for the right technologies for competitive marketing. Smart Weight Scale with Smart Weight Scale with POS systems manages the execution of retail transactions recording the receipt of funds, recording the completion of the transaction, and the issuance of receipts. In traditional point-of-sale (POS) systems, an in-house database server processes all sales transactions it receives from local client computers.Such systems incur high costs because of operational requirements, such as professional maintenance, the sophisticated server hardware required, and scalability requirements. For small retailers that want to use Smart Weight Scale with POS systems but have relatively limited financial resources, these expensive operational requirements are big obstacles.Considering these issues, the purpose of this paper is to suggest a Smart Weight Scale with POS system that is adequate for small businesses.
